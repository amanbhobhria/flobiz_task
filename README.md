## Code Architecture

This app follows the **MVVM architecture** for a clean and maintainable codebase.

1. **Add New Records:** Add expenses or income entries with a date, description, and amount.
2. **Search & Edit:** Search records by keyword and edit them as needed.
3. **Offline Support:** View cached data even when offline using Room Database.
4. **Sync with Firebase:** All changes are synced to Firebase Realtime Database.

## Future Enhancements

- Add pie chart visualization for income vs expense.
- Enable monthly and yearly summaries.
- Integrate user authentication.
