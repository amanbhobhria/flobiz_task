## Code Architecture

This app follows the **MVVM architecture** for a clean and maintainable codebase.

- **Model:** Contains data models and Room entities.
- **View:** Responsible for UI elements and observing LiveData.
- **ViewModel:** Handles business logic and provides data to the UI.
- **Repository:** Manages data sources (Firebase and Room Database).


## How It Works

1. **Add New Records:** Add expenses or income entries with a date, description, and amount.
2. **Search & Edit:** Search records by keyword and edit them as needed.
3. **Offline Support:** View cached data even when offline using Room Database.
4. **Sync with Firebase:** All changes are synced to Firebase Realtime Database.

## Future Enhancements

- Add pie chart visualization for income vs expense.
- Enable monthly and yearly summaries.
- Integrate user authentication.
